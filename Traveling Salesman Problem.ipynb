    "# Traveling Salesman Problem Solver using Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook contains a Python implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city.\n",

    "## Import Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing the necessary libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `numpy` for numerical operations.\n",
    "- `random` for generating random numbers.\n",
    "- `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting the results.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Define Distance Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance matrix is a 2D array that represents the distances between each pair of cities. In this case, we have a 5x5 distance matrix for 5 cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "distances = np.array([\n",
    "    [0, 29, 20, 21, 16],  # Distance from city 1 to others\n",
    "    [29, 0, 15, 19, 28],   # Distance from city 2 to others\n",

    "\n",
    "The `initialize_population` function generates an initial population of random paths that visit all cities and return to the starting city.\n",

    "## Calculate Fitness\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_fitness` function calculates the total distance of a given path.\n",

    "## Select Parents\n",
    "\n",
    "The `select_parents` function selects two parents from the population based on their fitness scores. Higher fitness scores (lower distances) have a higher probability of being selected.\n",

    "    parents = random.choices(population, weights=probabilities, k=2)\n",
    "    return parents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Crossover\n",
    "\n",
    "The `crossover` function performs single-point crossover between two parent paths to create a child path.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mutate\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mutate` function randomly swaps two cities in a path with a certain mutation rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def mutate(path, mutation_rate=0.1):\n",
    "    # Randomly swap two cities in the path\n",
    "    path = path[:-1]  # Remove the return to the start for mutation\n",
    "    if random.random() < mutation_rate:\n",
    "        i, j = random.sample(range(num_cities), 2)\n",
    "        path[i], path[j] = path[j], path[i]\n",
